# React, TypeScript, and Material-UI boilerplate

## Behind-the-scenes

Interested in learning how the app was built from scratch step-by-step on version 1.00? Check [it out](https://www.welcomedeveloper.com/react-typescript-material-design), developers!

The versions that followed the first one, 1.10 and 2.00, consist of adding coding formatting libraries (ESLint and Prettier), and updating the Material-UI library to its latest version (v5.0.1). I highly recommend you to explore the tutorial above to learn how the app was built.

## Features

The following frameworks/libraries have been implemented:

1. [React](https://reactjs.org/)
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
3. [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)
4. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
5. [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
6. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

## Install

To get up and running with the template, you just have to run the _git_ commands below:

```
git clone
cd react-mui-ts
yarn install
```

## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome to our repository, developers. The goal is to make it a space where we contribute together to make it better! Feel free to create your own _pull request_ with the contribution, or if you prefer, reach out to me with your idea üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
